    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jumbo breakfast cookies are perfect for grabbing on the way out the door.<br>
        Feel free to substitute chocolate chips or dried cranberries for the raisins or any combination of the three for a little different twist.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 cup butter or margarine</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups raisins</li>
        <li>6 cups toasted oat cereal rings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a very large bowl, mix together the sugar, peanut butter, butter, water, vanilla and eggs until smooth.<br> 
            Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the batter.<br>
            Mix in the oats and raisins, then carefully stir in the cereal.<br> 
            Drop 1/2 cupfuls of dough onto ungreased cookie sheets, spacing cookies about 4 inches apart.<br>
            Flatten cookies to 1 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are lightly browned at the edges.<br> 
            Let stand on the cookie sheets for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.<br> 
            Store at room temperature. I like to put each cookie into a sandwich bag which makes them easy to grab on the way out the door.</li>
    </ol>
